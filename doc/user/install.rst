============================
Installing and running khmer
============================

You'll need a 64-bit operating system, internet access, a C++11 compatible
compiler (e.g. GCC 4.8 or greater) and Python 2.7.x OR Python 3.3 or greater.

If you are running khmer in a HPC environment or for other reasons do not
have root access try creating a virtual environment as described in the OS X
instructions below (even if you are on linux) and then installing khmer in
that newly created virtual environment.

.. _osx-label:

Build requirements
------------------


OS X
^^^^

#) From a terminal download the virtualenv package and create a
   virtual environment with it::

      curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.11.6.tar.gz
      tar xzf virtualenv*
      cd virtualenv-*; python2.7 virtualenv.py ../khmerEnv; cd ..
      source khmerEnv/bin/activate

#) Go to :ref:`install-in-venv` to install khmer itself.

Linux
^^^^^

#) Install the python development environment, virtualenv, pip, gcc, and g++.

   - On recent Debian and Ubuntu this can be done with::

         sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-virtualenv python-pip gcc \
                g++

   - For RHEL6::

         sudo yum install -y python-devel python-pip git gcc gcc-c++ make
         sudo pip install virtualenv

#) Create a virtualenv and activate it::

      cd a/writable/directory/
      python2.7 -m virtualenv khmerEnv
      source khmerEnv/bin/activate

   Linux users without root access can try the OS X instructions above.


.. _install-in-venv:

Installing khmer inside the virtualenv
--------------------------------------

#) Use pip to download, build, and install khmer and its dependencies::

      pip2 install khmer

#) The scripts are now in the ``env/bin`` directory and ready for your
   use. You can directly use them by name, see :doc:`scripts`.

#) When returning to khmer after installing it you will need to
   reactivate the virtualenv first::

      source khmerEnv/bin/activate
